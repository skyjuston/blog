title: Israeli Intelligence Catches Russians using Kaspersky Antivirus Software to Conduct Espionage on U.S.

In 2015, Israeli intelligence officers conducting cyberespionage against antivirus vendor Kaspersky Labs uncovered evidence of Russian hackers exploiting their software products to gather information on U.S. intelligence programs.

Kaspersky's antivirus software, used by over 400 million people worldwide, was being used as an improvised search tool: the privileged status and access granted to the program to scan files was being abused to probe for American intelligence secrets. These findings, reported to the NSA, was a factor leading to a decision last month by the Department of Homeland Security to order Kaspersky software removed from government-owned computers.

In [a statement](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-statement-issuance-binding-operational-directive-17-01), the DHS explained the reason behind the decision: "The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security."

According to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html), who first broke the story on Tuesday, the Russian operation reportedly stole classified documents from a National Security Agency employee's home computer which ran Kaspersky antivirus. The employee, a member of the NSA's elite Tailored Access Operations unit, is currently under investigation according to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/israel-hacked-kaspersky-then-tipped-the-nsa-that-its-tools-had-been-breached/2017/10/10/d48ce774-aa95-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html).

Kaspersky confirmed the Israeli hack when it finally discovered the breach back in mid-2015, when an engineer discovered irregularities in the company's network. While the company did not explicitly attribute the attack to Israel, its [report](https://securelist.com/the-mystery-of-duqu-2-0-a-sophisticated-cyberespionage-actor-returns/70504/) on the incident found similarities between it and a previous attack by the name of "Duqu," which *was* attributed to those responsible for the renowned Stuxnet cyberweapon: America and Israel. 

In [a news release](https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2017_kaspersky-lab-response-to-the-unverified-claims-reported-by-the-new-york-times-on-october-10-2017), Kaspersky responded to the Times article: “Kaspersky Lab was not involved in and does not possess any knowledge of the situation in question, and the company reiterates its willingness to work alongside U.S. authorities to address any concerns they may have about its products as well as its systems.

“As there has not been any evidence presented, Kaspersky Lab cannot investigate these unsubstantiated claims, and if there is any indication that the company’s systems may have been exploited, we respectfully request relevant parties responsibly provide the company with verifiable information. It’s disappointing that these unverified claims continue to perpetuate the narrative of a company which, in its 20 year history, has never helped any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts."

Additionally, Germany's BSI federal cyber agency stated on Wednesday that it had no evidence to back up the media's claims, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-kaspersky-germany/germany-no-evidence-kaspersky-software-used-by-russians-for-hacks-idUSKBN1CG284). “There are no plans to warn against the use of Kaspersky products since the BSI has no evidence for misconduct by the company or weaknesses in its software,” BSI said in an emailed response.
