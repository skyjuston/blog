On Thursday, Hyatt Hotels Corp said it discovered unauthorized access to credit and debit card information across 41 of its hotels in 13 different countries.

Hotel guests are currently being warned of a potential breach, affecting customers who had their credit cards manually entered or swiped at the breached locations between March 18, 2017, and July 2, 2017.

Cardholder names, card numbers, expiration date and verification codes were all compromised, according to [a statement](https://www.hyatt.com/notice/protectingourcustomers/) made by Chuck Floyd, global president of operations.

According to [Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/hyatt-hit-by-credit-card-breach-again/128440/), China accounted for a large portion of hotels hit by the breach, with 18 hotels impacted.
