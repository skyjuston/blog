Vevo, a music video hosting and streaming service, was [subject to a leak](https://ourmine.org/news/2017/09/15/vevo-leaks-3-12tb-vevo-files/) by the OurMine hacker group, who uploaded 3.12TB of sensitive data containing office documents, videos, social media content among other things.

According to [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/welp-vevo-just-got-hacked-1813390834), who first broke the story, the data breach was the result of a successful phishing scam on the social media website LinkedIn. The contents were leaked after correspondence between OurMine and a Vevo employee that was skeptical of the hacker group's findings and told them to "fuck off":

The group, attributed to one teenager in Saudi Arabia [according to Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/this-saudi-teen-is-probably-behind-the-hacks-of-dozens-of-te?utm_term=.bsaWjYqpD#.xjL2Vgjo0), has been responsible for several hacks of celebrity, business, and institutional accounts according to their [website](https://ourmine.org/news/).

The [data was later taken down](https://www.ourmine.org/VEVOLeaks/) upon VEVO contacting the group.
