New York-based company Deloitte, one of the world's largest private accounting firms, [confirmed on Monday with news outlet The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/deloitte-hit-by-cyber-attack-revealing-clients-secret-emails) that it fell victim to a data breach that compromised their global email server. The security incident was discovered back in March, and it is believed that the hack may have made vulnerable the usernames, passwords and details of the firm's top clients.

However, estimates by The Guardian, confirmed by an anonymous source [in an article by security blog Krebs On Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/source-deloitte-breach-affected-all-company-email-admin-accounts/), placed the time of the intrusion as far back as fall of 2016. An internal company memo circulated last October mandating that employees change their passwords and personal identification numbers in short time supports this idea. 

The hackers were able to get into Deloitte's cloud email server by way of an administrator account protected by single password authentication rather than two-factor authentication. Through the administrator account, the perpetrators were able to access the platform used by the firm's 244,000 staff, hosting about five million emails.

"Responding to questions from the Guardian, Deloitte confirmed it had been the victim of a hack but insisted only a small number of its clients had been 'impacted'," The Guardian's Nick Hopkins wrote. So far only six of Deloitte's clients have been briefed on the impact the breach had on their data, according to the article.

According to Krebs on Security's anonymous source, several gigabytes of data were found being sent back to a server located in the United Kingdom.

Deloitte has initiated its own private investigation into the matter, deploying both internal and external cybersecurity experts and contacting government officials. 

Deloitte is a brand consisting of tens of thousands of independent firms around the world. The firms are part of "Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (DTTL)," a private company based in the United Kingdom. Referred to as one of the "Big Four" accounting firms, Deloitte [announced](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/global-revenue-announcement.html) a record revenue of $38 billion USD for the fiscal year 2017. The firm provides a breadth of services, including auditing; financial and risk advisory; tax services,and ironically, cybersecurity consulting.

This breach is only the latest in a string of hacks this year that have affected high-profile companies including Equifax, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), HBO, and Maersk.
