title: "Orchid Labs Develops New Open-Source Protocol for a Decentralized, Surveillance-Free Internet"

A group of open-source developers under the name [Orchid Labs](https://orchidprotocol.com/) have created an open-source, decentralized protocol meant to defeat Internet surveillance and censorship. 

The new protocol, named Orchid, runs on top of existing Internet infrastructure, and is driven by a peer-to-peer bandwidth exchange in the form of 'Orchid Tokens', which are based on Ethereum, according to Orchid Labs' [whitepaper](https://orchidprotocol.com/whitepaper.pdf). The developers at Orchid Labs have designed the protocol under the belief that everyone around the world deserves the Internet, and that individuals have the right to control their own personal data.

"We’re​ ​excited​ ​to​ ​be​ ​doing​ ​our​ ​part​ ​to​ ​help​ ​solve​ ​issues​ ​related​ ​to​ ​censorship​ ​and​ ​surveillance that​ ​have​ ​so​ ​far​ ​remained​ ​unsolved.​ ​By​ ​bringing​ ​a​ ​new​ ​approach​ ​via​ ​the​ ​Orchid​ ​network,​ ​we believe​ ​that​ ​as​ ​a​ ​community,​ ​we’ll​ ​finally​ ​be​ ​able​ ​to​ ​create​ ​an​ ​internet​ ​free​ ​of​ ​monitoring​ ​and personal​ ​data​ ​harvesting," Orchid Labs wrote in a statement.

The 'decentralization' part of the Orchid protocol comes from the way it handles Internet traffic. Rather than route traffic through central authorities such as Internet Service Providers or VPNs, data is routed through a randomized network of users who sign up to contribute their extra bandwidth, and set their Internet-connected device as a 'node'. Users who choose to access these networks exchange Orchid tokens in order to pay the contributors of these nodes through a peer-to-peer exchange. Neither the payment nor traffic can be monitored by authorities, meaning the exchanges and traffic are fully anonymous.

The way Orchid operates has been considered by some to be similar to [how the Tor network operates](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en), which encrypts then randomizes the route that data travels through a network of relays operated by volunteers.

"Tor actually is a centralized service where nine directory servers are able to decide the state of the network; we are accepting nothing less than a fully-decentralized system," Jay Freeman, one of the protocol's designers,wrote in a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15576457), where he posted under the nickname saurik.

Among the founders of Orchid Labs are the original author of the GNU Bash Shell Brian J. Fox, and Gustav Simonsson, one of the developers who helped launch Ethereum in 2015. [Crunchbase's](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/orchid-labs) entry on Orchid Labs indicates that the organization has raised $4.7 million in seed money from investors as of October 26, 2017.

"We​ ​need​ ​an​ ​internet​ ​that’s​ ​inclusive​ ​and​ ​not​ ​controlled​ ​by​ ​centralized​ ​organizations whether that’s​ ​corporations​ ​or​ ​countries.​ ​The​ ​citizens​ ​of​ ​the​ ​world​ ​have​ ​a​ ​fundamental right​ ​to​ ​speak​ ​to each​ ​other​ ​and​ ​access​ ​information.​ ​At​ ​Orchid​ ​Labs,​ ​we’re​ ​tackling​ this​ ​problem​ ​by​ ​utilizing​ ​an open-source​ ​protocol​ ​that​ ​protects​ ​users​ ​from​ ​being​ monitored,​​while​ ​allowing​ ​them​ ​to​ ​access the​ ​entire​ ​internet."
