On Tuesday, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an [advisory](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2017/10/24/Multiple-Ransomware-Infections-Reported) concerning Bad Rabbit, malware supposedly deriving from the Petya family of ransomware.

According to a [BBC report](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41740768), the ransomware has been spreading in Eastern Europe. In particular, Russia has been impacted the most by Bad Rabbit, where the majority of the infected clients are.

At least three media organizations in Russia have been hit by the ransomware, according to Russian cybersecurity company Group-IB. According to their [write-up of the incident](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/badrabbit), victims were tricked into agreeing to a FlashPlayer update. Once the user agreed, a malicious file named install_flash_player.exe was downloaded and infected the host once executed. Decryption of the files involves paying a bitcoin ransom equivalent to $283 within a specified time period. If the victim is not able to pay before the time limit, the price of the ransom increases.

Group-IB also determined that Bad Rabbit "was able to spread via web traffic from compromised sites." This method is also known as a 'drive-by' attack, which involves the unintentional download of malware onto a client.
