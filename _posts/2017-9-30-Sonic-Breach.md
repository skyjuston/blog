Sonic Drive-In, a fast-food restaurant chain, has experienced a data breach of their store payment systems, according to an article posted to [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/breach-at-sonic-drive-in-may-have-impacted-millions-of-credit-debit-cards/) on Thursday.

The stolen data, consisting of credit and debit card information, may have affected five million customers. It was found that the accounts were part of a batch of stolen cards that had been put up for sale on the credit card theft bazaar Joker's Stash.

In response, several data breach class action lawsuits have been filed against the company, according to [Oklahoma News 4](http://kfor.com/2017/09/28/sonic-drive-in-hit-with-lawsuits-after-credit-card-hack/). Federman and Sherwood, an Oklahoma City-based law firm, was the first to do so.

A [second class action lawsuit](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sonic.pdf) for negligence was initiated at a federal court in Oregon, claiming that Sonic "failed to maintain adequate technological safeguards to protect plaintiffs’ information from unauthorized access by hackers," in an attempt to increase profits. Additionally, the complaint alleges that "Sonic Corporation unjustifiably failed to timely notify consumers of its data breach in the most expeditious manner possible, and only chose to notify consumers of its breach after hackers were caught attempting to sell its stolen information in underground cybercrime stores."

An internal investigation by Sonic is underway. The number of impacted stores is still unknown.

In a statement issued to Krebs On Security, Sonic responded: "Our credit card processor informed us last week of unusual activity regarding credit cards used at SONIC. The security of our guests’ information is very important to SONIC. We are working to understand the nature and scope of this issue, as we know how important this is to our guests. We immediately engaged third-party forensic experts and law enforcement when we heard from our processor. While law enforcement limits the information we can share, we will communicate additional information as we are able."

The same response was sent to Oklahoma News 4, on Twitter:
